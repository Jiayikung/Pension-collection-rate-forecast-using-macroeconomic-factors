    "Taiwan's National Pension Insurance aims to ensure the unemployed and economically disadvantaged individuals can enjoy their elderly life at the basic economic level. However, its collection rate had decreased remarkably over time, which even declined to 48% since 2018, mainly because the insured cannot afford the premium. Most of the citizens also called it “the punishment of being unemployed.” Therefore, in order to enhance the collection rate of National Pension Insurance, the effect of macroeconomic factors on the collection rate must be explored. \n",

    "### Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Taiwan's population is aging, and as a result, society is paying more and more attention to the life insurance provided to retirees. Other insurances in Taiwan, however, have higher insured requirements, making it impossible for residents with incomes below the average to get insured. As a result, on October 1, 2008, the government of Taiwan passed National Pension Insurance. National Pension Insurance, according to the Bureau of Labor Insurance, Ministry of Labor (2007), aims to ensure the basic economic security for citizens who are unable to be adequately covered by related social insurance when they become old, pregnant, or suffer from a mental or physical disability, as well as the stability of their survivors' lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taiwanese between the ages of 25 and 65 who have not enrolled in other social insurance programs, such as labor insurance, are compelled to join the National Pension Insurance program. Every two months, they will be required to pay the pension by the Ministry of Labor. The government will provide these insurance holders with the following advantages after they turn 65: old-age pension payments, maternity payments, pension payments for mental and physical disabilities, death payments, and pension payments for surviving family members. Furthermore, because the majority of insured people are unemployed or economically disadvantaged, the government won't penalize people who miss their deadlines for paying their premiums. However, if they don't pay back the premium within ten years, they will lose their eligibility to receive benefits in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of National Pension Insurance is to ensure that these unemployed and economically underprivileged seniors can live out their later years at a basic standard of living. However, the majority of these citizens, who are in the greatest need of National Pension Insurance, are unable to pay the premium or repay the payment within ten years. According to the information shown in Figure 1, the insurance collection rate noticeably decreased from 77.1% in 2008 to 41.4% in 2021. Additionally, Figure 2's explanations for the nonpayment of pensions show that up to 38% of the respondents said they could not afford to make the payment. Apparently, it's worthwhile to investigate whether promoting real economic development might increase the rate at which National Pension Insurance is collected."

    "### Literature Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies on the organization, or the comparison of National Pension Insurance in various nations, and studies on its effects can be can roughly be divided into two categories in Taiwanese research.\n",
    "Hsu (2009) compared the National Pension Systems in Japan, Germany, and Taiwan for the purposes of comparisons between various nations in order to gain a thorough understanding of the function and potential difficulties of the system and to make recommendations to the government for its potential implementation in the future. Szu (2009) examined the content and issues of the five benefit payments and used many theories to describe the present disagreements on the legitimacy of the premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of salary distribution, which Moene and Wallerstein (2001) utilized to determine the income distribution from 2008 to 2010, was also employed by Shie (2012) to assess the impact of National Pension Insurance on income redistribution. He came to the conclusion that the current National Pension Insurance does not achieve the goal of income distribution by cash transfer. This is likely because the main objective of National Pension Insurance is to ensure that the non-income population can maintain a higher standard of living when they get older, not to narrow the wealth gap. Using the social accounting matrix, Lu (1999) confirmed the impact of National Pension Insurance on macroeconomics and developed a projecting model to forecast its macroeconomic consequences. She came to the conclusion that the projection result offers a fresh viewpoint on the social cost of National Pension Insurance while being consistent with academic beliefs.\n",
    "Yu (2018), on the other hand, looked at how the consumer price index (CPI), average GDP per capita, economic growth rate, unemployment rate, savings rate, and savings rate affected the amount of National Pension Insurance that was collected. He applies the fundamental statistical analysis, ADF single root verification, Granger causality test, vector self-regression model, and multiple regression model to the time-series data from 2008 to 2017. The results show a correlation between the collection rate and the unemployment rate that is positive, and a correlation between the collection rate and average GDP per capita, savings rate, and CPI that is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key contribution of this study is that we added the lagged effect and the temporal trend to further explore the impact of the CPI on the insurance collection rate. In order to offer a more complete conclusion, we also incorporate controlled variables into the discussion.\n"

    "## <span style=\"color:blue\">Section 04. Conclusion</span> \n",
    "Holding all other factors constant, the findings point to a negative link between economic factors and the collection rate that is statistically significant at the 5% level. The reason why they are negatively correlated may be because one of the biggest properties lies in the pension policy: Paying premium is not mandatory since this pension is aimed to design for those who are unemployed or economically disadvantaged. Hence, this will provide citizens opportunities to choose their investment products other than national pension insurance, in order to ensure they can enjoy their elderly life at the basic economic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "With better economic development, citizens do not have to worry they may lose their job in the future, and thus do not have the demand to insure the national pension insurance. Also, there are lots of alternatives to pensions in the financial market. While the national pension is only at the bottom of Taiwan’s social security system, and it can only provide people with the most basic living security, the incentives the national pension has are limited. That is, citizens with spare income may choose to buy stocks or bonds instead of national pension insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study is limited by the absence of regional series data on the collection rate of the National Pension Insurance, which might be Taiwan's panel data. We could also examine the subject by taking into account additional intersectional elements, such as gender, age, education, and the government's budget for promoting National Pension Insurance, in addition to the macroeconomic ones."
