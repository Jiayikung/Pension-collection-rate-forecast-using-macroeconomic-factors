# Pension-collection-rate-forecast-using-macroeconomic-factors
<br>This study analyzes the causal relationship between the collection rate of National Pension Insurance and the consumer price index (CPI) in Taiwan. The collection rate of National Pension Insurance had decreased remarkably over time, which even declined to 41.4% in 2021, mainly because the insured cannot afford the premium. Most of the citizens also called it “the punishment of being unemployed.” Therefore, in order to enhance the collection rate of National Pension Insurance in Taiwan, the effect of the CPI on the collection rate must be explored. We use the time-series data in Taiwan by taking the multiple regression analysis. The result reveals that the CPI has a significantly negative effect on the collection rate without the lagged effect. Moreover, we control for the time effect and economic dependency ratio in the model and conduct the robustness check. Future research could include the collection rate of National Pension Insurance in Taiwan’s different regions, concluding a more comprehensive outcome with a panel data analysis.
